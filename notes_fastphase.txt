From the paper: 
Haplotypes of these SNPs were inferred for each species separately by FASTPHASE (Scheet & Stephens, 2006) 
using default parameters except for the maximum number of EM iteration that was set to 50. The subpopulation 
option was used to specify four populations within species. Five, 10 and 15 clusters of haplotypes were 
considered for determining the number of haplotype clusters.
